# master_deploy.yaml - Build a container image for Jenkins masters and
#                      create deployments of that image in OpenShift
#
# Usage:
#     ansible-playbook playbooks/master_deploy.yaml -i $INVENTORY
#
# Where $INVENTORY is an invertory file listing the names of the Jenkins
# masters we want to install or configure. An example for such an inventory
# file can be found at:
#
#     playbooks/inventories/example_master.yaml
#
# Prerquisites for running:
# * You need to have `oc` installed and logged in to OpenShift and set to use
#   the namespace you want to have things installed in.
# * You need to install Ansible as instructed in the README.md file
# * You need to have 4G persistent volumes ready for use in your OpenShift
#   cluster or a dynamic storage provisioner that can create them. You will need
#   one volume for each master that you create.
#
# Example - setting up the `example-master` instance:
#
#     ansible-playbook playbooks/master_deploy.yaml \
#       -i playbooks/inventories/example_master.yaml -v
