          unstable-message: >

            It seems that this change attempts to target one or more
            non-existent change queues.

            This could be because support for a version of oVirt that
            this change targets had ended or because a change queue for
            it was not yet created.

            Please remove 'build-artifacts' jobs targeting non-existent
            change queues.
          notbuilt-message: >

            This change was not submitted to any change queues for
            system testing. You will need to create some
            'build-artifacts' jobs if you want changes to be submitted
            to change queues, take part in the system tests and be
            deployed to the nightly snapshot repositories. If your project uses
            STDCI V2 and you have release branches configured, you may disregard
            this message.
